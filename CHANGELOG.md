The old addedCount can be obtained by `const addedCount = event.addedCount - event.removed.length`

* Fix to cancel contradictory gesture events (e.g. tap and double tap) introduces the following behavior breaking change

Before:
* **iOS / Android**:
    * double tap: child tap -> parent tap -> child double tap -> parent double tap
    * tap: child tap -> parent tap

After:
* **iOS**:
    * double tap: child double tap
    * tap: child tap
* **Android**:
    * double tap: child double tap -> parent double tap
    * tap: child tap -> parent tap

Migration steps:
Move event handlers accordingly.

* **iOS:** update platform declarations ([f54f71b](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/commit/f54f71b))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **android:** NativeScript core framework now extends support library APIs versus native framework classes as per Google's latest guidelines ([#6129](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues/6129)) ([cf034dd](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/commit/cf034dd)):
    - NativeScript activities now extend `android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity` (vs android.app.Activity)
    - NativeScript fragments now extend `android.support.v4.app.Fragment` (vs android.app.Fragment)
    - NativeScript now works internally with `android.support.v4.app.FragmentManager` (vs android.app.FragmentManager)

The implications of these changes should be mostly transparent to the developer except for the fact that the support library Fragment / FragmentManager work with Animation APIs versus Animator APIs.

For Android API Levels lower than 28 the new Fragment API uses a different fragment enter animation by default. You can customise the transition per navigation entry or globally via the [navigation transitions API](https://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/navigation#navigation-transitions)
Before:
Default fragment enter animation was fade animation

After:
Default fragment enter animation for API levels lower than 28 is now a fast "push fade" animation; default fragment enter animation for API levels equal to or greater than 28 remains fade animation

* Layout class (`tns-core-modules/ui/layouts/layout`) is now removed as it is not used in {N} framework any more.

Before:
Built-in {N} layouts GridLayout, StackLayout, WrapLayout, etc. extended `Layout` class

After:
Built-in {N} layouts GridLayout, StackLayout, WrapLayout, etc. now extend `LayoutBase` class

To migrate your code follow the example below:

Before:
``` ts
import { Layout } from "ui/layouts/layout";
// ...

let wrapLayout: Layout;

export function pageLoaded(args: EventData) {
     const page = <Page>args.object;
     wrapLayout = page.getViewById<Layout>("wrapLayout");
 }
```

After:
``` ts
import { LayoutBase } from "ui/layouts/layout-base"; // or import { WrapLayout } from "ui/layouts/wrap-layout;
// ...

let wrapLayout: LayoutBase; // or let wrapLayout: WrapLayout;

export function pageLoaded(args: EventData) {
     const page = <Page>args.object;
     wrapLayout = page.getViewById<LayoutBase>("wrapLayout"); // or wrapLayout = page.getViewById<WrapLayout>("wrapLayout");
 }
```
* **android:** change androidOffscreenTabLimit to 1 when using bottom tabs of tab-view([#6476](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues/6476)) ([371fc9b](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/commit/371fc9b))

* **ios:** widgets native view lifecycle refactoring - native view is now created right before they are added to visual tree ([#6102](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues/6102)) ([46705ee](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/commit/46705ee)):

The iOS widgets native view lifecycle now matches the Android widgets. Before, the iOS native view was created in the widget constructor and you could manipulate the native view right after the widget is instantiated. After the refactoring, the widget's native view will be created when it's added to the visual tree. The most correct way to manipulate the native view is in the `loaded` event handler.

Before:
``` ts
import { Button } from "ui/button";
// ...

const button = new Button();
button.nativeView.someNativeAPIMethod();
```

After:
``` ts
import { Button } from "ui/button";
// ...

const button = new Button();
button.on("loaded", () => {
    button.nativeView.someNativeAPIMethod();
});
```

* **ios:** Widgets that inherit the `ContainerView` class now overflow the safe area by default ([#6230](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues/6230)) ([982acdc](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/commit/982acdc)):

These are: `AbsoluteLayout`, `DockLayout`, `GridLayout`, `StackLayout`, `WrapLayout`, `FlexboxLayout`, `ScrollView`, `ListView`, `WebView` and `Repeater`.

The change is that now if these widgets touch the edge of the safe area, they will be automatically expanded to the edge of the screen. This will change their width and height. Margins and paddings will still be applied only in the safe area. This behavior can be reverted to the old one by setting the `iosOverflowSafeArea` property of the widget to `false`.

    * You need to use **Array\<string>** (lowercase **string**) instead of **Array\<String>** (uppercase **String**) when overriding a method accepting string array type.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **ios-layout** Frame, Page and TabView measure/layout methods no longer used. We now rely on the iOS to position these controls. As a result width, height, minWidth, minHeight, margins won't be respected on these controls
* **ios-layout** Layouts for ViewContollers now implemented with UILayoutGuide (requires iOS 9)
* **tabview** TabViewItems are now loaded/unloaded on demand - when they will be displayed.
* **webpack:** Extending classes requires marking the derived class with @CSSType
The root classes are not marked with CSSType and classes derived from ViewBase and View
will continue to work as expected. More concrete view classes (Button, Label, etc.) are
marked with @CSSType now and store their cssType on the prototype suppressing the previous
implementation that looked up the class function name. So clien classes that derive from one of
our @CSSType decorated classes will now have to be marked with @CSSType.
* **android-images:** change decodeHeight/decodeWidth properties to accept device independent pixels by default
* **image-source:** Change the return type of `setNativeSource` method from `boolean` to `void`.

### Breaking changes
-  [(#242)](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/issues/242) View and GesturesObserver classes have some breaking changes related to gesture operations


## 1.0.0 (2015, April 29)

### New
* New options for camera module. Added a resizing options along with keep-aspect-ratio options. More information about how to use it can be found at the dedicated camera help article.
* First-file search order changed. Now package.json is searched first, then index.js and bootstrap.js is being searched last.

### Fixed
* Taking a full size picture in Android with NativeScript camera module.
* Pages no longer freeze on cancelling back-navigation via swipe gesture.
* Items having verticalAlignment set to center now have correct layout bounds.
* Camera for iOSs no longer throws a Null pointer error.
* iOS dialog OK button now appears last.

### Breaking changes
* `image-cache` now stores native image instances, i.e., `android.graphics.Bitmap` or `UIImage`.
* `Image.src` property is now of type `any` and can accept either a string containing an image url or a native image instance.
* Gesture-related enum values changed to start with a small letter in order to be consistent with all other enums within NativeScript. For example, "gesturesModule.GestureType.Tap" should be used like "gesturesModule.GestureType.tap".
* `knownEvents` modules within all UI controls are removed and replaced with a static string values. In that case, all possible events will be visible through the inheritance tree. These static strings have an `Event` suffix. Every place where `viewModule.knownEvents.loaded` is used should be changed to `viewModule.View.loadedEvent` or `pageModule.Page.loadedEvent`. This change is relevant to code-behind only (xml declaration will not be affected).

## 0.10.0 (2015, April 17)

### Fixed

### New

* In addition to binding converters introduced in version 0.42 static (global) place for most common converters is added. This place is named `application.resources`. More information about how to use it can be found in the special help topic: `Data binding`.

* Using plain objects (numbers, strings also an entire object) as binding context via `$value`. More information can be found at the dedicated `Data binding` help topic.

### Breaking changes

  * Image: `url` property renamed to `src`.
  * Image: `source` property renamed to `imageSource`.
  * TabView: `TabEntry` renamed to `TabViewItem`.
  * Module `local-settings` changed to `application-settings`. Only the name of the module is changed (API remains the same), hence the `require` statements must be updated, i.e., `require("local-settings")` should be changed to `require("application-settings")`.
